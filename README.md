Controls Yamaha AV receivers and MusicCast devices from ioBroker over the local
network. It unites the three protocols Yamaha speaks — YNCA (the text control
protocol of the networked receivers), MusicCast / Yamaha Extended Control (the
richer JSON protocol of the MusicCast generation), and the legacy XML protocol
of the oldest pre-2010 models — behind one object tree.

## Features

- **One adapter for three protocols** — classic Yamaha AV receivers over YNCA, MusicCast devices over Yamaha Extended Control, and pre-2010 receivers over the legacy XML protocol, replacing the separate yamaha and musiccast adapters.
- **Automatic reconnect** — the YNCA connection recovers on its own after a receiver reboot or a network drop, so control keeps working without restarting the adapter.
- **Per-zone amplifier control** — power, volume, mute and input for the main zone and each additional zone a device reports.
- **Capability-driven object tree** — states are generated from what each device actually reports over its protocol, not from a hardcoded model list.
- **One transport chosen per device** — YNCA where the receiver speaks it, MusicCast for speakers and soundbars, XML for the oldest models.
- **Network discovery** — a search button finds Yamaha devices over SSDP and fills the device table.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- js-controller >= 7.2.2
- admin >= 7.8.23

## Installation

Install the adapter from the ioBroker admin.

## Configuration

Add each Yamaha device with a name and its IP address.

## Changelog

<!--
	Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
	### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->
### 0.6.0 (2026-08-01)
- Rebuilt from the ground up as one adapter for classic Yamaha AV receivers, MusicCast devices and the oldest pre-2010 receivers, replacing the separate yamaha and musiccast adapters.
- Each device is driven over the protocol it actually speaks — YNCA (with automatic reconnect after a reboot or network drop), MusicCast, or the legacy XML control protocol.
- Every device exposes power, volume, mute and input per zone, generated from what it actually reports rather than a hardcoded model list.
- Finds Yamaha devices on the network by itself: a search button in the settings fills the device table over SSDP.
- Now requires Node.js 22, js-controller 7 and admin 7.

## History

The yamaha adapter has a long lineage on ioBroker, and this version continues it —
for existing users it is simply a new version of the same adapter:

- **[soef](https://github.com/soef)** created the adapter in 2015 and built the
  original control over Yamaha's XML network protocol, with realtime state updates
  and multi-zone support.
- **[Garfonso](https://github.com/Garfonso)**, **[Sneak-L8](https://github.com/Sneak-L8)**
  and **[Apollon77](https://github.com/Apollon77)** contributed over the following
  years — admin compatibility, fixes and Sentry crash reporting.
- The **[ioBroker Community Adapters](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters)**
  team — notably [foxriver76](https://github.com/foxriver76) and
  [mcm1957](https://github.com/mcm1957) — maintained the adapter from 2020 to 2026,
  releasing versions up to 0.5.4.
- From this version on, [krobi](https://github.com/krobipd) rebuilds the adapter from
  the ground up in TypeScript, uniting the YNCA, MusicCast (YXC) and legacy XML
  protocols behind one object tree.
