// Fleet master (.consistency-master/src/lib/diagnostics/report-jobs.ts) — never edit the copy in an adapter.
//
// Diagnostics report standard (krobi 2026-10-06, page "Diagnosebericht — Flottenstandard", C3):
// the admin's `diagnostics` message. `list` names every device, connected or not (DB-03); `start` begins one device's
// report and answers at once with a job; `result` hands the finished report over once. The admin's browser connection
// gives up on every answer after 30 s (admin 8.0.23 `lib/js/socket.io.js`, `Date.now() + 3e4`), and a report may take
// longer — so no answer waits for one. The report lives in memory until the card fetches it, never on disk (DB-01);
// an unfetched one is dropped by the next message after KEEP_MS (no timer). A device that is not connected is never
// read live (DB-03): `readLive` is called for connected devices only, and the report then says so.
